#summary A TODO list for the project...
#labels Featured,Phase-Requirements

==Version 0.1== -- 0%
  * add shader support #medium priority
  * enable shadows via shaders (might be as simple as implementing shader) #medium
  * look into creating a color picker and testing speed trade-offs... #low
  * implement Cal3D animated models #high
  * implement ODE (for at least collisions, but go for fully...) #medium
  * implement some kind of fast depth sorting #very low
  * allow true blending on all objects (once depth sorting is in) #extremely low
  * look into mapping as much as possible to vertex arrays instead of display lists... #low
  * Add subImage rendering for 2D - ie, a lot of images in one, only rendering a part though... #high
  * Add a 2d gui!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! #medium
  * Add 3d sound module using pygame, OpenAL or pymedia #medium-low PyMedia seems best...
  * Add AABox, Sphere and QuadTree objects into PYGGEL - added to objects and the scene... #high priority - lots of potential uses for that I think...
  * Add Cached and simple versions of A-star #medium priority
  * use QuadTree and Sphere bounding volumes to perform frustum culling on all objects #high priority
  * Splitting the view among viewports - and having Ortho match... #low priority
  * Allow each scene to have eight lights, and have them generate automatically - instead of only 8 global lights... #medium

==Version 0.05-alpha1== -- 90-95%
  * Toggling of display settings #Done!
  * Image2D/Image3D #Done!
  * OBJ mesh loading #Done!
  * Geometry classes #Done - ongoing (if/when we need more types)
  * Texture, DisplayList, VertexArray and VertexBuffer objects #all but VBO's done... not sure if we need VBO's either...
  * Particle effects #Done!
  * Picking #Done - only select buffer picking for now - save color buffer picking for next release (if any...)
  * Camera class objects: Third-person, First-person #Done!
  * math3d class with Vector, Sphere and AABox features (among other standard 3d functions) #Vector and math functions done (ongoing) Sphere/AABox still needed...
  * Font support #Done!
