NEW REQUIREMENTS:

Python 2.7
Pygame 1.9.1
PyOpenGL 3.1.0
Numpy 1.9.1



Libraries (thinking about adding):

ODE (physics and bone animations?)
PIL (for better image manipulation)
PyOpenGL_accelerate (should enhance speed considerably)
GLE (this should have come with installer - does it?)

psyco (needed?)


(opengl context requirements, possibly needed for particle effects)
simpleparse 2.1.1
PyVRML97 2.3.0a4
pydispatcher 2.0.5
OpenGLContext 2.2.0a3



Thoughts:

How to load models with bones (and better yet, skeletal animations)
Need fast terrain rendering, that allows for fluid manipulation (addition, subtraction, changing) of points and materials

The "Hack" disabling glGetError checking after every call does not work in this version of pOGL, it may be inside accelerate



Features wanted:
2d rendering (with speedups where possible)
GUI system (mouse event based, primarily)
	themeable with json files? O.o
	custom mouse cursors as part of the gui
3d Model loading, animation, and bones (for attaching objects)
3d textures (if possible, to create texture sets for larger areas)
	Or method for multi texturing
"Container" objects that optimize rendering of shapes (terrain or models specifically) using one or more textures
	This must allow for editing points, however...
Particle Effects - is there a library for this?
Multiplayer (should this be integrated, added on, or not part?)
